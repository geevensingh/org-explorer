# Org explorer

A private, offline-first Windows org explorer with rich person profiles, person
notes, manager-owned team context, and observed reporting history.

The agreed first release targets Windows 11 x64 using .NET 10, WPF, and Velopack.
People, notes, photos, and history live in readable local files. An external
provider such as OneDrive owns synchronization and conflict resolution.

## Specifications

- [Agreed v1 design](docs/design.md)
- [Domain vocabulary](GLOSSARY.md)
- [Import contract](docs/import-format.md)
- [Machine-readable import schema](schemas/import-v1.schema.json)
- [Example import files](docs/examples/)
- [Architectural decisions](docs/adr/README.md)
- [Installer, updater, and signing research](docs/research/installer-updater.md)

## Run the first tracer

On Windows 11 x64 with the .NET 10 SDK:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src\OrgExplorer.Desktop
```

Choose an empty local folder outside the installation, then **Open Workspace**.
Choose a version-1 JSON file, review **Preview import**, and deliberately **Apply
reviewed import**. Select the Person and edit the profile fields; changes are saved
locally as you type. Empty editor text explicitly clears a nullable value;
whitespace-only text is rejected with a field-specific error. Preferred name is
the prominent heading, while Directory name remains visible and independently
editable. Email is a non-editable identity. Reopen the same Workspace to retrieve
saved data. The app does not upload Workspace data.

Textual profiles accept `displayName`, `preferredName`, `alias`, `jobTitle`,
`department`, `officeBuilding`, `officeNumber`, `officeState`, `officeCountry`,
and `linkedInProfileUrl`, alongside `email` and `managerEmail` in the existing
version-1 import envelope. Alias is a short company handle, not a preferred name
or email. Building/room identifiers and geographic fields remain separate,
unaltered text, including letters and leading zeros.

An office-only import preserves names, links, all other omitted values, and
omitted people. Explicit null clears nullable fields after preview and Apply;
empty/whitespace-only import strings are errors, not clears. Preferred name and
LinkedIn URL have no protected override layer: explicitly importing them replaces
local values. Notes and unknown fields are rejected for the whole batch.

LinkedIn links require a valid absolute HTTPS URL. Displaying/editing the profile
never fetches the URL or other remote content. **Open saved LinkedIn URL in
browser** deliberately hands the saved link to the default browser; browser
opening failures are visible without changing the profile.

Contract fields owned by subsequent slices are still explicitly rejected rather
than discarded. The full import contract remains unchanged.
For example:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "batchId": "10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001",
  "observedAt": "2026-11-01T17:00:00Z",
  "people": [
    { "email": "avery@example.com", "displayName": "Avery Example", "managerEmail": null }
  ]
}
```

The shared `IApplicationWorkflow` owns lifecycle, preview/apply, validated edits,
projections, status, and persistence; WPF uses its observable `WorkspaceViewModel`
adapter. File parsing/storage stay behind that seam. See
[Workspace format and recovery](docs/workspace-format.md).

## Validation and CI

```powershell
dotnet restore OrgExplorer.slnx --locked-mode
dotnet build OrgExplorer.slnx -c Release --no-restore
dotnet test OrgExplorer.slnx -c Release --no-build
dotnet run --project tests\OrgExplorer.Desktop.Smoke -c Release --no-build -- src\OrgExplorer.Desktop\bin\Release\net10.0-windows\OrgExplorer.Desktop.exe
.\tests\CiGate.Tests.ps1
```

The smoke runner requires an interactive Windows desktop and drives the actual
WPF controls using Windows UI Automation. It launches the normal app without
test-only flags, applies an import, opens a profile, edits, closes, and reopens to
verify durability. It also edits every textual profile field, checks validation,
reopens, reviews/applies an office-only import with an explicit clear, and reopens
again to prove unrelated attributes survived. A controlled loopback endpoint
checks that rendering a stored HTTPS link makes no network request; core tests
control the browser-opening boundary without opening production pages.
Tests use fictitious people and isolated folders beneath the
checkout, cleaned after each run.

Every PR and main commit (without path filters) runs three independent parallel
jobs: core/view models, real filesystem persistence, and actual Windows desktop
smoke. `CI` runs even after lane failures and accepts only three `success`
results. Cancellation/timeout cannot yield a successful required check.
Dependency lock files support the initial SDK/package cache. Each lane includes
restore/build/test within an eight-minute timeout; the aggregate has two minutes.
Thus the execution critical-path bound is ten minutes and the summed job budget
is 26 minutes, both below 30 (runner queues excluded). Five minutes is the target,
not a claim about unmeasured hosted-runner performance.

Main is protected by an active GitHub **ruleset**, with no bypass actors,
requiring PRs and a strict up-to-date `CI` check from GitHub Actions. Only squash
merges are enabled. `eng\Configure-Repository.ps1` reapplies and verifies those
settings using the explicitly routed account; it does not push or merge code.

Installer, automatic updates, complete imports, reporting/history/notes features,
and release signing are subsequent slices, not shipped capabilities of this tracer.
